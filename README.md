What is the Business Problem of These Stores?

Vrinda Stores wants to create an annual sales report for 2022 so that they can better understand their customers and increase sales in 2023.

Sample Questions:

Compare the sales and orders using a single chart.
Which month had the highest sales and orders?
Who purchased more in 2024â€”men or women?
What are the different order statuses in 2024?
List the top 10 states contributing to the sales.
What is the relationship between age and gender based on the number of orders?
Which channel is contributing the most to sales?
What is the highest-selling category?

This is the chart we can check all the data through that sheet.

Step of the projects : - 
Step 1: Check the Google Sheet to see if the data is helpful in solving those particular questions or not.
Step 2: Data Cleaning,Check the sheet to see if each column's data is correct.
        Specifically, check the first column, 'Order ID,' for any duplicate or null values using the filter function and other colum also.
step 3: Data Processing -  grouping the age data
      i)=IF(E2>=50,"senior",IF(E2>=30,"Adult","Teneger"))
     ii) add one column Month =TEXT(G2="MMM") 
Step 4: Data Analysis-

      Place the "Amount" and "Order ID" in the values section of the pivot table.
      Place the "Month" in the rows section of the pivot table.
